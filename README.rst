Welcome to Blacktie!
==========================

This package is functional but under heavy development so you may want to periodically
pull the latest code from the repo at git://github.com/xguse/blacktie.git.

For the **LATEST** version pull the 'develop' branch.

**I seek collaboration and contributions to improve this tool.**  

**PLEASE** take it and run with it, but send me your progress!

Its goal is to **simplify the integration of all the
input/output streams of the tophat/cufflinks workflow** into a single yaml based config
file and automate as much of everything else as possible so that once the config file
is filled out, **the entire process of analyzing a multi-condition RNA-seq experiment can
be run with a single command.**
