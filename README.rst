This file STILL requires editing
==========================

This package is still VERY raw and not complete.  However the tophat and cufflinks steps
have been written and passed preliminary functionality tests.  I seek collaboration and 
contributions to improve this tool.  Its goal is to simplify the integration of all the
input/output streams of the tophat/cufflinks workflow into a single yaml based config
file and automate as much of everything else as possible so that once the config file
is filled out, the entire process of analysing a multi-condition RNA-seq experiment can
be run with a single command.  I have not had time to fill in all the doc strings but will
soon.  If you want to use/contribute before the docs are complete, please contact me at 
wadunn83@gmail.com for guidance.
